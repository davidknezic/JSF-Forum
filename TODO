TODO
====

This is a list of tasks to complete in the future. Feel free to extend!

1. High priority
----------------

2. Normal priority
------------------
* Avoid empty tables without corresponding messages for the end-user
* Limit the title and content lengths when displaying latest threads, threads and latest replies (with converters)
* Better place the information on thread facelet
* Show last user activity when on profile facelet and rearrange information
* Add 'joined on ...' on the user list
* Redirect user to his new thread, after creation

3. Low priority
---------------
* Put the db connection information into an external config (xml) file
* Optimize performance (caching?)
* Maybe we could use ORM instead of the current unflexible, hardly maintainable models
