TODO
====

This is a list of tasks to complete in the future. Feel free to extend!

1. High priority
----------------
* Implement authentication on controller level (UserModel.authenticate() already available)
* Enable thread, reply creation (depedent on previous task)

2. Normal priority
------------------
* Avoid empty tables without corresponding messages for the end-user
* Limit the title and content lengths when displaying latest threads, threads and latest replies

3. Low priority
---------------
* Optimize performance (caching?)
* Maybe we could use ORM instead of the current unflexible, hardly maintainable models
