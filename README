1. Description
--------------
JSF-Forum is a small and simple forum written on top of JSF (Java Server Faces). It is developed as a school project.

2. Requirements
---------------
In order to run this project you have to make some preparations, which are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The required libraries must be obtained and included into the classpath:
* jsf-impl.jar (http://javaserverfaces.java.net/)
* jsf-api.jar (is bundled with jsf-impl.jar)
* mysql-connector.jar (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
* apache-codec.jar (http://commons.apache.org/codec/)
* apache-io.jar (http://commons.apache.org/io/)
* apache-lang.jar (http://commons.apache.org/lang/)

All these libraries can be downloaded in one package from:
http://tmp.davidknezic.com/jsf-forum_lib_20110410.tar.bz2

The database tables must be created using the structure.sql file and eventually filled by the statements from content.sql.

The database settings, currently found in src/models/DBConnection.java, must be adjusted.
